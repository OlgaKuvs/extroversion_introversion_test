The Extroversion-Introversion test is a psychological assessment tool designed to measure an individual's personality traits related to extroversion and introversion. Extroversion and introversion are fundamental dimensions of personality proposed by Swiss psychologist Carl Jung.

Extroversion refers to a person's tendency to seek external stimulation and derive energy from social interactions. Extroverts are often outgoing, assertive, and enjoy being around people. They tend to be talkative, energetic, and may exhibit a preference for engaging in activities involving others.

Introversion, on the other hand, reflects a preference for internal reflection and solitude. Introverts tend to be more reserved, thoughtful, and prefer quiet environments. They may feel drained by excessive social interactions and require alone time to recharge their energy.

Ambiversion refers to a psychological concept that describes individuals who exhibit a balance between extroversion and introversion. An ambivert is someone who does not strongly lean towards either extreme of the extroversion-introversion spectrum but rather falls somewhere in the middle.

Unlike strict extroverts or introverts who lean heavily towards one end of the spectrum, ambiverts can adapt their behavior and energy levels to different social settings. They may enjoy and feel energized by social interactions, but also value and seek out periods of solitude and reflection.

This very simple test will allow the user to check whether he is an extrovert, an introvert or, like most people, an ambivert.
